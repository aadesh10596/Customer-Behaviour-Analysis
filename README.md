# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover insights related to revenue generation, customer loyalty, subscription effectiveness, and product performance. The analysis combines Python for data preparation, SQL for business querying, and Power BI for interactive visualization.

The goal is to support data-driven decision-making for marketing, customer retention, and sales optimization.

## Tech Stack

Python – Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis

SQL Server – Business queries and aggregations

Power BI – Interactive dashboard and insights visualization

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level transactional data including:

Customer demographics (Gender, Age Group)

Purchase details (Purchase Amount, Product, Category)

Behavioral metrics (Previous Purchases, Subscription Status)

Logistics information (Shipping Type)

Customer feedback (Review Ratings)

Discount application details

## Analysis Workflow
### Data Preparation (Python)

Loaded and validated raw data

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Performed exploratory data analysis

Analyzed purchase amount and rating distributions

Prepared clean data for SQL and Power BI

### Business Analysis (SQL)

SQL was used to answer key business questions such as:

Revenue contribution by gender

Impact of discounts on high-value customers

Subscription vs non-subscription spending behavior

Top-performing products and categories

Customer segmentation based on purchase history

Revenue contribution by age group

Relationship between repeat purchases and subscriptions

### Data Visualization (Power BI)

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created featuring:

KPI cards (Customer Count, Average Purchase, Average Rating)

Revenue and sales by category

Subscription status distribution

Sales and revenue by age group

Dynamic filters for deeper analysis

### Key Insights

Subscribed customers generate higher average and total revenue

Discounts do not negatively impact high-spending customers

Clothing is the top-performing category

Young Adults are the most profitable customer segment

Loyal customers are more likely to subscribe

## Business Recommendations

Promote subscription plans to returning customers

Apply discounts strategically to price-sensitive products

Focus marketing efforts on high-revenue age groups

Strengthen loyalty programs to improve retention

Prioritize high-rated and best-selling products
